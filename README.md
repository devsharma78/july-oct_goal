Machine Learning, Data Science and Generative AI with Python

The "Machine Learning, Data Science and Generative AI with Python" course on Udemy covers a wide array of essential topics in the field. Students learn about deep learning techniques, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP's), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's) using TensorFlow and Keras. The course also delves into the intricacies of modern generative AI with a focus on transformers, self-attention, and large language models like OpenAI's GPT and ChatGPT. Furthermore, it equips learners with the ability to create synthetic images using Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE's) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's). With a practical approach, the curriculum includes data visualization using Python libraries, sentiment analysis, regression analysis, clustering methods, and principal component analysis, along with an understanding of various model evaluation and optimization techniques such as train/test, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

For the concluding assignment, I am tasked with implementing multiple supervised machine learning methods on the publicly available "mammographic masses" dataset. The objective is to determine the most accurate technique by utilizing K-Fold cross-validation (with K set at 10). The specific algorithms to be applied include Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. By examining the outcomes of these techniques, the aim is to identify the one that achieves the highest accuracy for this dataset.
